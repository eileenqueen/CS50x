Week 1
======

Toward the beginning of the lesson, the instructor made a joke about how jumping into coding was kind of like trying to drink
from a firehose.  As the lesson progressed, we learned about C language, and given my previous knowledge of Terminal and some other
languages, I felt like I had a pretty good footing.  Then I got to the homework.

And *hello*, firehose.

Before now, I've been using Codecademy as my primary source of coding knowledge and practice.  I really love their interface and 
usually have a lot of fun learning the blocks of code they focus on.  That being said, they don't really inceitivise you to think 
creatively about solving problems.  When I started trying to code the CS50 homework questions, I was in for a pretty rude awakening.

I'm too embarrassed to say how long I spent on the first problem.  ~~I even had to sleep on it!~~  But do you know what?

I woke up the next morning with a bunch of new ideas, and realized that I'd completely missed the mini-lecture series, and was
able to watch everything and get my code to work before lunch.  The next question went even more quickly (even with my !successful!
debugging), and the third - which was optional - was even faster.

Basically, what I'm trying to say is that my old method of "Take a walk and just think about it" isn't always going to work.

But it's chill.  I'm even more motivated by "Just think about proving to your future nieces and nephews that you can do 
anything if you put your mind to it."

Homework
-------

I won't be posting my solutions to the homework since it wasn't a creative project like the Scratch game.
